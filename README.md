## *Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp*

This repository contains my **solution** for each **LAB challenge** given during the [bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/) (June to December 2021).

<br>

### Main knowledge and tools:
```

▫️ Python

▫️ Pandas

▫️ SQL – PostgreSQL

▫️ Statistics

```


### Statistics:
* *"Data Science Math Skills"* course offered by Duke University (Durham, US) [@coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills/home/info) completed in June 2021.

### List of files and what I have learned – in descending order

<br>

* Lab #33 → `w16_05_linear_regression_LAB.ipynb`

   - covariance and correlation
   - build a linear regression model
   - split the data into train and test
   - fit the model, the algorithm will learn about the data pattern
   - evaluate the model
   - predict data
   - visualize the results

<br>

* Lab #32 ⟶ `w18_04_probability_distributions_LAB.ipynb`

   - generate and plot normal distributions
   - probability mass function (PMF)
   - poisson distribution
   - central limit theorem
   - normal distribution
   - *scipy.stats*
